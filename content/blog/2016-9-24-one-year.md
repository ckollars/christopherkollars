It was just a little over a year ago I packed up my belongs, almost all, and drove West. It was something I've never done, just move to a whole new city let alone state. Well I take that back. I moved from small town of less than 300 to the big city that's Omaha for college. I had been there ever since.

In all honesty I wasn't sure if this is what I wanted or needed but I had to try. I knew a few friends from Omaha that moved out a few years before so I wasn't moving to a new city without knowing anyone. I atleast had that.

Since I've been out here I've experience things on a regular basis that seem just a part of a normal life. For starters, commuting by other means. What I mean is I commute regularly by bike and occasionally by bus, tram, Lyft. Just having these options within a city is something I look back thinking why wouldn't a city have these options.

I had a few goals I was wanting to accomplish

- date
- up my career level
- have more outdoor adventures in actual mountains and forests
