Last SID I worked with a few people to rework our mobile testing frameworks. The current setup is using Appium and what I'm seeing so far is I'm not a fan yet. It just seems so combersome to get anything working and especially on iOS. I hope this doesn't steer me away and I can get into learning this process for end 2 end testing.
