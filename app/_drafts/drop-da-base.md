#Drop-da-base

For awhile now I've been working on a base site structure to use to start new projects. Some people call this boilerplate

##Grunt
It's been tough with grunt and converting it to a different approach with each task split into it's own.

##Sass 
* Setting up the directory is different then I've been using the past year and ahalf.
* Not sure if this is perfect still but it's a work in progress for SASS
* New is also icomperating Bourbon instead of Compass
	* Not sure why I'm using Borubon but it feels like I use it more to it's fullest
	* With Bourbon I'm looking at using Neat as my grid framework. *Talk on this more*
* BEM approach. Right now it's really rough and probrobably incorrect but it's a start

##Bower
* first time using
* looking to use for jquery, modernizer, bourbon, neat and other libraries

## HTML Snippets
* I'm looking to incorprate more of these module code base.
* unsure how as of now

## Things I'm looking to use
* looking to use sprockets instead of @imports

## Git
* Wanting to incorporate small commits. It's right now the hardest things to do.
