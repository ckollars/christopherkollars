Over the last month I've been working implementing the philosophy of [BEM](https://bem.info/method/) ( Block, Element, Modifier ) with my CSS. I have to admit it's been tough. I feel the frustrations are coming from keeping all my class and files orgainized. I do tend to fall back to old ways which makes things even more difficult. Also I'm not saying my old ways are bad but they weren't great.

As of now I'm only following this method on my current project which is a bit messy. I will be going back to clean things up when I'm done but for now excuse my mess. 

In all I'm enjoying writing my CSS in this fasion with hopes of making a "boilerplate/styleguide" going forward.
