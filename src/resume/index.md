## Summary

I've been involved with the web in some way for over 20 years. I started in a startup company before anyone knew what a startup was. From there I worked most of my career in marketing and advertising with building websites and digital marketing material. 5 years ago I moved back into the startup world working a product servicing the restaurant industry. My focus has been frontend development but I've also been involved with the full stack development.

## Experience

#### Projects
**Aim High Air Force**

Last six months I've been working on an application for the US Air Force called Aim High. Aim High is an Android and iOS application that allows users such as, parents, spouses and significant others to follow a loved one going through basic training in the US Air Force. The application is also used by US Air Force Recruiters to comminucate with their recruits in the "on boarding" process and as well many more tools to help recruiters.

- I helped create an online application for enlisted officers to apply for positions posted within the Air Force. This helped staff members to remove the process of paper form applications and decrease the time it to process applicants.
- Working with UX to gather design elements to help start a design system, first in Figma then following with updated component code across a few applications used within the Aim High stack.
