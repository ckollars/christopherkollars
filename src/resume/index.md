## Summary

I've been involved with the web in some way for over 20 years. I started in a startup company before anyone knew what a startup was. From there I worked most of my career in marketing and advertising with building websites and digital marketing material. 5 years ago I moved back into the startup world working a product servicing the restaurant industry. My focus has been frontend development but I've also been involved with the full stack development.
