Today an old friend and fellow collaborator Carl Avidano of [Milestone Creative](http://milestone-creative.com) hit me up on chat. The normal conversation of how's work and life. We then moved it over to a Skype call and an hour letter I feel reenergized.

From this conversation it made me think that my life and work balance has the same struggles that other people have. What's great though is hearing how these people have overcome these or even steps they do to help improve themselves is always invigorating.

So by the end of it all Carl and I came to the conclusion that I need to start reading books and Carl is back to reading two a week. As we laugh about it, this is the start of our "book club". An hour on a Monday morning.
