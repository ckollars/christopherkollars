A good friend, Tory Burke, sent me an email a few weeks ago wondering what I my thoughts were on a few questions he had. It was a busy day and I didn't have enough time to give a better explanation and answer so I thought it would be a good idea to bring it to the web.

## Do you have any thoughts about HTML 5?
**My short answer:** *I'm not fully using it yet. On smaller sites yes but one of my goals is to by end of summer.* I feel this wasn't really answering the question.

**My long answer:** I'm not sure if I have much to say on this. As mentioned I currently don't use HTML5 fully. I've slowly been incorporating some of the tags such as:

			<header>
			<footer>
			<nav>

What makes HTML5 the buzzword I feel is canvas. I don't know much about this except I feel it's a new way to bring Flash like capabilities built into the browser.

## Where do you see the developer position going in the next couple years? Apps, websites, etc.
**My short answer:** *This is longer discussion.* Since I didn't really have an answer for this I went the quick response.

**My long answer:** 

3. Is a web browser battle happening right now?
4. Did Mozilla ban Flash from its browser and is Flash dead?
