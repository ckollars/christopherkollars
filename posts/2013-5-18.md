The other day I had a good friend Carl hit me up on chat asking how much I know about javascript. Well my first thought was, somewhat decent, but instead I replied back with pretty good. Once saying this I realized I may be in a word of hurt but that wasn't the case.

He sent me over a code snippet
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ckollars/5605947.js"></script>

My first glance it looked simple enough but Carl said he wants it to work on a class with very high possibilities that class will be used multiple times on one page. This is where I started to get stumped.

I got things working, well sort of. It was animating the scroll effect but it was doing on all specified classes and it was only scrolling the width of the container not the inner content.
