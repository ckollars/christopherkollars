Title: Taking Chances with No Regrets
Excerpt: You can plan your life all you want but the road is unpredicatable. When things come your way, grab ahold and take that chance.

On May 29th, I started a new path I thought I'd never take; I became a full-time freelancer. Many of you may know me, so you've heard me talk about this idea for a few years but I finally made the decision.

How did I come to this decision? I'm not 100% sure. It's something I've been afraid of, but I thought to myself, "why not?". Over the years I've met and worked with some amazing people. I've learned a lot from them and I am very grateful.

Moving forward, I'm still going to do development work but move my focus more away from CMS-driven marketing sites and heavier on campaign-driven applications. I'll likely still be working with CMSs like Wordpress or Drupal, but I want to learn new techniques like site generators, Ruby, APIs and new processes that allow me to work as efficiently as possible.

Along the way I also hope to work with some talented people with whom I can share my experiences and learn from theirs. I [mentioned](http://christopherkollars.com/post/christopherkollars.com-v2.0-i-guess) this before, I plan to continue to blog once a week, sharing new ideas, thoughts and tools I've learned as well as projects I hope to be a part of. 

For now I plan to work from my home office (which is actually my living room). It's pretty tiny, but it works. I'll also work from local coffee shops such as [Omaha Bicycle Co.](http://www.omahabicycleco.com/) and [Aromas](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Aromas-Coffeehouse/193049144080984?fref=ts) to name a few. Since I now office out of my house, I wanted to share my setup. I re-arranged my living room/office to help me get a window view while working.

Stay in touch as I make this journey. *Salute and here's to changes*.
