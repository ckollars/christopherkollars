Starting June 1st, I will be doing freelance/contract work. It's been something I've dreamed of doing since I started working in this field. 

Many of you know me others might be finding this for the first time but I have had one hell of a career. It all started back in 2001..

I learned basic web development with Flash. Actionscript was my skill for a few years but then their was a new web movement. Web standards and separating content from style.
