Starting June 1st, I will be doing freelance/contract work. It's been something I've dreamed of doing since I started working in this field. 

Many of you know me and others might be finding this for the first time but I have had one hell of a career. It all started in 2001 where I learned basic web development with Flash and Flash Actionscript 1.0. From there I moved from all design to more development especially when web standards and css craze started.

Over the years I've enjoyed every decision I made in my career even if they never went the way I had planned. I feel everything I've experienced I learned from as well has put 110% into it. Now going forward I'm looking at making more tangible experience and really push myself in my skills and in my life. I know it's not an easy thing. I know I might fail but I know I won't go out without a fight. 

To all this I also want to thank everyone in my life that I have connected with. If that's professionally, personally or socially. 

Salute and here's to a new life change.
