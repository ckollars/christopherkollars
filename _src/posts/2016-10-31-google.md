Sometimes, well most times, I need to look up a code snippet or common design trend. I forget quite often how to do the most common tasks. I feel bad having to do this. Why don't I have this saved in a tool chest?

I think about this every time and every time I Google, find an example and go from there. This weeks it's a modal. Next week it's an ajax form. Yet still I'm here Googleing, "How do I do that thing..."
