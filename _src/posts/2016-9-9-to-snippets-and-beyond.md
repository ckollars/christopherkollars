I've recently added a few snippets to my editor, Sublime Text and it's been a really great help. Snippets is definitely something I've been wanting to start using but just hadn't taken the time to setup. No clue why but now I wish I would have sooner.

I just add a few basic ones that I seem to have to write frequently. On of those is my SASS media query include.

```sass
@include mq(m) {

}
```

I hope to keep adding more so if you want to use some of them for yourself head on over to [Github](https://github.com/ckollars/snippets)
