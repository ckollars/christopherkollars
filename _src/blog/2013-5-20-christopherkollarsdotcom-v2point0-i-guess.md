title: "Christopherkollars.com v2.0 I guess?"
excerpt: I'm unsure if I can call it v2.0 since 1.0 only had three posts in a year. You know what though, I can version my site how I see fit!

Well I started this blog to learn to communicate and write my thoughts better. It was almost a year ago and I only submitted 3 posts. Even though I failed first time around I'm getting back on the horse.

I hope to write once a week. In fact I'm going to put it as a daily todo until it's finished for that week. To celebrate this new pledge to my writing I decided to give my site design a refresh. I am  happier with this layout then the previous but as always I hope to tweak and add a few features I didn't get completed.

You can see that I put all of the source code on GitHub. Now it's a bit messy with some bad practice that might make you (Hell, even me) cringe but I'll be cleaning this up over the next 30 days. In fact, down the road, I might even look at moving away from Scriptogram and try out other static site generators, such as [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

If you stumble across any issues please submit an issue through [GitHub](https://github.com/ckollars/christopherkollars). Stay tuned as I have more to write.
