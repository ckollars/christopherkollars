Recently I was working on a javascript project that someone else created. I needed to fix a few things and add a new feature. The person previously created this little log function that was part of the main object.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ckollars/5665348.js"></script>

Now I know it's the simplest thing but totally takes care of having to delete <code>console.log()</code> on code going to a production site. I know it's the little things but this is something I'm going to include in all my projects going forward.
