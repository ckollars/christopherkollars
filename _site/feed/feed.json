This wasn't my first rodeo especially with working with multiple developers. What was needed was pretty simple. So I first started viewing things in the Chrome's inspector just to get a sense of what and where I needed to make the changes. Thanks to source maps, it was pretty straight forward.</p>\n<p>I pulled up the SASS file where I need to make the change. I did a little jump to a line feature in Sublime Text but the class I was looking for wasn't on that line. It was about a 30 or so lines down further.</p>\n<p>Everyone is aware of the ampersand selector with sass. If the <code>&amp;</code> is before a declaration it's part of the declarations parent. If it's after the declaration then that class has to become before all the other classes in it's declaration.</p>\n<pre><code>  .block {\n    &amp;.block--modifier {\n      display: block;\n    }\n\n    .block__parent &amp; {\n      display: inline-block;\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Got it — Good!</p>\n<p>Now I've been using SASS this way since I started but on this project I seen that the previous developer started using the <code>&amp;</code> for declaring it's children classes. For instance:</p>\n<pre><code>.block {\n    display: inline-block;\n\n    &amp;--modifier {\n      display: block;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now when that outputs it'll be 2 separate classes.</p>\n<pre><code>.block {\n  display: inline-block;\n}\n.block--modifier {\n    display: block;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>When I looked at this I totally get it. I see the benefits of how this will speed up coding, leaner modular code; but there was an issue I jumped at me right away.</p>\n<p>When using source maps and inspecting an element it doesn't show exactly where this declaration is in the sass file. It ends up showing where it's parent was first declared. Now if your code is lean and which I try to strive to have mine but honestly this isn't always the case and in my case there was a lot of modifiers and elements being declared this way.</p>\n<p>So I looked past this and tried to do a project search for <code>.block--modifier</code> but the search came up empty as it should. This class was never fully written out since it was nested inside the parent and declared as <code>&amp;--modifier</code>.</p>\n",

The normal conversation of how's work and life. We then moved it over to a Skype call and an hour letter I feel reenergized.</p>\n<p>From this conversation it made me think that my life and work balance has the same struggles that other people have. What's great though is hearing how these people have overcome these or even steps they do to help improve themselves is always invigorating.</p>\n<p>So by the end of it all Carl and I came to the conclusion that I need to start reading books and Carl is back to reading two a week. As we laugh about it, this is the start of our &quot;book club&quot;. An hour on a Monday morning.</p>\n",

I have to admit it's been tough. I feel the frustrations are coming from keeping all my class and files orgainized. I do tend to fall back to old ways which makes things even more difficult. Also I'm not saying my old ways are bad but they weren't great.</p>\n<p>As of now I'm only following this method on my current project which is a bit messy. I will be going back to clean things up when I'm done but for now excuse my mess.</p>\n<p>In all I'm enjoying writing my CSS in this fasion with hopes of making a &quot;boilerplate/styleguide&quot; going forward.</p>\n",

Colaboration, project management, to-dos and of course git versioning.</p>\n<p>###Sublime Text 2</p>\n<p>I enjoy this editor greatly. It's the simple but I still am learning to get more use out of it's features. My next move is to start making code snippets as well as a good boilplate/framework. I'd hate to call it that but basically I want a standardize my developing techniques.</p>\n<p>###SCSS/SASS</p>\n<p>I can't go forward on any project without implementing this. Such a better way of writting CSS. I did use SCSS for about 6 months with Compass. It was a nice addition but I don't think it's for me. <a href=\"http://codyjamespeterson.com\">Cody</a> has turned me onto <a href=\"http://bourbon.io/\">Bourbon</a>. It's a great mixin library with less overhead then Compass.</p>\n<p>New to the list is a few other techniques. Grunt, ruby and node.js. I'm really new with these, 4 weeks new, but from my short use I see huge benefits with them.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>On May 29th, I started a new path I thought I'd never take; I became a full-time freelancer. Many of you may know me, so you've heard me talk about this idea for a few years but I finally made the decision.</p>\n<p>How did I come to this decision? I'm not 100% sure. It's something I've been afraid of, but I thought to myself, &quot;why not?&quot;. Over the years I've met and worked with some amazing people. I've learned a lot from them and I am very grateful.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, I'm still going to do development work but move my focus more away from CMS-driven marketing sites and heavier on campaign-driven applications. I'll likely still be working with CMSs like Wordpress or Drupal, but I want to learn new techniques like site generators, Ruby, APIs and new processes that allow me to work as efficiently as possible.</p>\n<p>Along the way I also hope to work with some talented people with whom I can share my experiences and learn from theirs. I <a href=\"http://christopherkollars.com/post/christopherkollars.com-v2.0-i-guess\">mentioned</a> this before, I plan to continue to blog once a week, sharing new ideas, thoughts and tools I've learned as well as projects I hope to be a part of.</p>\n<p>For now I plan to work from my home office (which is actually my living room). It's pretty tiny, but it works. I'll also work from local coffee shops such as <a href=\"http://www.omahabicycleco.com/\">Omaha Bicycle Co.</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Aromas-Coffeehouse/193049144080984?fref=ts\">Aromas</a> to name a few. Since I now office out of my house, I wanted to share my setup. I re-arranged my living room/office to help me get a window view while working.</p>\n<img src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2243605/site/img/office.jpg\">\n<p>Stay in touch as I make this journey. <em>Salute and here's to changes</em>.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>The other day my friend Carl sent me a Google chat asking how much I know about javascript. I first thought to myself, hey I'm somewhat decent instead I replied back with I'm pretty good. Once saying this I realized I may be in a world of hurt so he sent me over a code snippet.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/ckollars/5632128.js\"></script>\n<p>My first glance it looked simple enough. Carl wanted to use classes instead of an ID. Doing this would we could specify one class and use it on multiple DOM elements on the page.</p>\n<p>I started with changing the javascript to jQuery. I didn't change much of logic since it was already working but doing just this ended up as a fail. A couple more changes and I got things working, well sort of. It was animating the scroll effect but it was doing this on all classes on the page. Plus it was only scrolling the width of the container not the inner content width.</p>\n<p>I started dissecting the code more and decided to do this as OOP programming. It's something I haven't had a lot of experience with but I wanted to learn and needed to learn. Referencing code samples across the internet. This got me understanding creating objects. I ended up looking at the jQuery from a Drupal module called Quicktabs that I was using on another project. From this I really started to understand objects and extending them.</p>\n<p>It was a lot of trial and error; reading Stackoverflow and watching tutorials on jquery.com. And with all this I ended up get things working.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/ckollars/5632122.js\"></script>\n<p>Now the only thing is to slow down the speed of scrolling so it's legible. The culprit is <code>animate()</code> so I'm looking at implementing <code>setTimeout()</code> that would move in increments per millisecond. I'm still working through this problem and hope to add to the functionality.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>Well I started this blog to learn to communicate and write my thoughts better. It was almost a year ago and I only submitted 3 posts. Even though I failed first time around I'm getting back on the horse.</p>\n<p>I hope to write once a week. In fact I'm going to put it as a daily todo until it's finished for that week. To celebrate this new pledge to my writing I decided to give my site design a refresh. I am happier with this layout then the previous but as always I hope to tweak and add a few features I didn't get completed.</p>\n<p>You can see that I put all of the source code on GitHub. Now it's a bit messy with some bad practice that might make you (Hell, even me) cringe but I'll be cleaning this up over the next 30 days. In fact, down the road, I might even look at moving away from Scriptogram and try out other static site generators, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll\">Jekyll</a>.</p>\n<p>If you stumble across any issues please submit an issue through <a href=\"https://github.com/ckollars/christopherkollars\">GitHub</a>. Stay tuned as I have more to write.</p>\n",

			"content_html": "<p>My usual photo editing application and what I usually receive web layouts in is Photoshop. Since I'am working with Matt Linder and his choice of application, Fireworks, I'll will be slicing his layouts from Fireworks instead of exporting the layout to Photoshop.</p>\n<p>The major issue I've had between Photoshop and Fireworks has been Fireworks slower responsiveness. I always feel when you select an objects in Fireworks and look at the properties palette that I am either really fast or the application takes a second to populate with its properties. That is my number one issue with the application.</p>\n<p>Window focus is another. More often then not I usually have to click twice on an object because it seems I need to set focus to the window first before I can click on an object. This happens the most when switching between apps.</p>\n<p>Groups, I dig this idea because I was Freehand fan but I feel this concept is a little archaic. I'm not sure if I feel this way because I'm used to Photoshop and the use of folders to group things. I don't have a huge issue with this. I think I just like my folders versus groups.</p>\n<p>A few really positive things would be the vector capabilities and slicing techniques. It makes more sense than Photoshops slice tool but in the end I feel just these 2 things can't trump the sluggishness I get from Fireworks.</p>\n",

For some reason I just never focused on my web presence but over the last few months I've been wanting to do so.</p>\n<p>I've finally decided to just start a blog. A place to write my thoughts, show some code examples and to speak my mind. Basically learn to write and do it well.</p>\n<p>So a few weeks ago it came up in discussion with <a href=\"http://blog.codyjamespeterson.com\">Cody Peterson</a> of <a href=\"http://secretpenguin.com\">Secret Penguin</a> that I've been wanting to just start a site, a blog, where I could have place to do all of this. He was actually wanting to do the same and had been writing down his ideas for awhile but never had time come up with a site for himself.</p>\n<p>Last week Cody said he has a site built. I couldn't believe it. How does this guy have the time with his busy schedule but then he showed me a simple solution. It's called <a href=\"http://scriptogr.am\">scriptogr.am</a>. A simple platform that uses Markdown and Dropbox. Well of course this got me interested so I signed up and spent few hours playing around with the CMS and settled on what you are seeing now. It's not even close to being finished but I felt it's a good start. It's simple and focused on the writing, which is what I wanted.</p>\n<p>Going forward I hope to be sharing more, at least once a week, so if you'd like, which I hope you do, come back and ready my fumblings as I explore my writing ability and code antics.</p>\n",
