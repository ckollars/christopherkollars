<p>###Github</p>
<p>I continue to use this but even more with a few projects just in the past few weeks. Can't say how much I love this product. It has so much to offer. Colaboration, project management, to-dos and of course git versioning.</p>
<p>###Sublime Text 2</p>
<p>I enjoy this editor greatly. It's the simple but I still am learning to get more use out of it's features. My next move is to start making code snippets as well as a good boilplate/framework. I'd hate to call it that but basically I want a standardize my developing techniques.</p>
<p>###SCSS/SASS</p>
<p>I can't go forward on any project without implementing this. Such a better way of writting CSS. I did use SCSS for about 6 months with Compass. It was a nice addition but I don't think it's for me. <a href="http://codyjamespeterson.com">Cody</a> has turned me onto <a href="http://bourbon.io/">Bourbon</a>. It's a great mixin library with less overhead then Compass.</p>
<p>New to the list is a few other techniques. Grunt, ruby and node.js. I'm really new with these, 4 weeks new, but from my short use I see huge benefits with them.</p>
